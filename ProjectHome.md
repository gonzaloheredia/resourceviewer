# Introduction #

Resource Viewer (catchy title, I know!) is an upcoming modern resource viewer for Mac OS X v10.5 written in Cocoa and Objective-C. Longing for the days of ResEdit on Mac OS 9? Tired of Resourcerer's horrible<sup>[1]</sup> interface (I know I am)? Want something quick to view or grab resources out of Carbon application?

Resource Viewer is an open-source Cocoa application, using pxmLib ( Â© Blackhole Media Copyright, Peter Hosey and Colin Barrett, used without their endorsement) and "IconFamily.m" (http://iconfamily.sourceforge.net/) to help bring Resource Manager files to the 21st Century. This application will require Mac OS X v10.5.

# Status #

A very shaky initial SVN tree is available just as a proof of concept. Most of my work is on the Leopard fork of the tree and I have to backport and redesign a lot of stuff to make it allowable for source release. Not worth trying to compile, but you may poke around.

# Features #

  * Lickable User Interface (Vive la Delicious Generation!)
  * Icon and CoverFlow Mode
  * Live Searching
  * 'Extract' feature to quickly export resources to files
  * Resource Hex Viewer
  * Cocoa application (that's a feature! isn't it?)
  * Open-Source (BSD/MIT license)

# Goal #

I plan to make this a full resource editor in the future, however I have to start with the easier stuff. ResEdit was the coolest little application on OS 9, and for lack of a good free OS X alternative I decided to start this.

<sup>[1]</sup> This is the opinion of myself, and I alone. Resourcerer is a brilliant application, please go and check it out.
